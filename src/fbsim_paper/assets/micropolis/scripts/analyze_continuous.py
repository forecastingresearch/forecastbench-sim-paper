"""Score the continuous eval: CRPS tables by metric and by horizon.

Reads data/micropolis/continuous/{label}/data.json, written by
scripts/run_eval_continuous.py. Prompts no models and runs no simulations, so
it is cheap to re-run while changing how the numbers are presented.

The config selects which slice of the dataset to score — its models, cities,
disasters, snapshot_turns and horizons — so one gathered dataset can be viewed
many ways. Naming anything the dataset lacks is an error, not a smaller table.

Writes every table and figure to one Markdown report per normalization,
data/micropolis/continuous/{label}/analysis-crps-{norm}.md, rather than to
stdout: normalized CRPS against horizon; a table of Spearman and Pearson
correlations between the per-model mean nCRPS and the capability predictors
(ECI, knowledge eval), pooled and per horizon, each with two 95% bootstrap
intervals — over models and over questions; forecast skill against ECI; and
the correlation of ECI and the knowledge-eval score against horizon, compared
against each other. Every correlation carries both intervals. --no-plot skips
the figures. Only the paths written and the reports' own paths are printed to
stdout.

CRPS is reported normalized — divided by something that makes it unitless —
and there are three things worth dividing by. One run computes all three, each
to its own report and figures, tagged -{norm} in the filename so the sets sit
side by side rather than overwrite each other:

  global    a fixed per-metric scale, the same for every question, so a cell
            is comparable across scenarios, snapshots and horizons.
  local     the mean the question's own metric took over the reseeded
            continuations of its scenario, snapshot and horizon.
  baseline  the expected CRPS of the persistence forecast: the mean of
            |snapshot - outcome| over those same continuations. 1.0 is then
            "as good as assuming nothing changes", which is the one mode whose
            scale carries its own zero point.

The last two read data/micropolis/ground_truth/, so they need
scripts/extract_ground_truth.py to have covered the config — and since every
mode is computed on every run, so does the script as a whole. Both divide by a
number the question itself supplies, which goes to 0 where a metric provably
could not move — a city whose traffic is pinned at 0 across every continuation
— and near 0 where it barely could; both therefore floor the denominator at
--norm-global-frac of the metric's global scale, and each report says how many
questions that floor bound. The modes are not comparable with each other, so
the mode is stated wherever a normalized number is.

Every normalized view comes twice, once per measure: normalized CRPS scores
the five percentiles against the one realized continuation, and excess
normalized CRPS scores them against all the reseeded continuations of the
question's scenario, snapshot and horizon — the mean pinball loss over every
continuation's outcome — minus the floor that the continuations' own five
quantiles would score, so it is 0 only for a forecast equal to the replay
distribution and never rewards a lucky draw. The excess is divided by the same
per-question scale as the plain measure. This is FreeCiv's excess CRPS, so the
two worlds' excess figures are on one footing.

Beside the reports it writes continuous_scores.csv: one row per model x metric
x horizon, plus an "all" metric and an "all" horizon per model, with the
forecast counts, the raw CRPS and the normalized CRPS under every mode side by
side, then the raw excess CRPS and the excess normalized CRPS under every mode
— the tables' numbers in a form the next analysis can load rather than parse
out of fixed-width text. One file for all three modes, so unsuffixed.

    (all five quantiles equal) reduces to absolute error, so the pinball loss is
