"""Gather the article's data: one long CSV per eval, under data/micropolis/paper/.

The scoring half of the paper pipeline. Reads the two evals' gathered datasets
and the ground truth, scores every forecast with the reports' own scoring
functions, and writes one row per (model, question) — the grain the scores are
actually computed at, not a per-model mean:

- binary_forecasts.csv: model, question, section (the paper's question set,
  by the instance's ground-truth P(Yes): see question_set), horizon, the
  forecast, that p, and the Brier, excess Brier and excess bits.
- continuous_forecasts.csv: model, question, city, metric, horizon, the raw
  CRPS and the excess CRPS. Both are unnormalized: the paper divides by the
  city's own scale, which is a join analyze_paper.py does against the file
  below, so the scale can be changed without re-scoring.
- city_metric_scales.csv: one row per city of the continuous config, the mean
  each metric took over the turns up to the first snapshot, floored at a
  per-metric minimum so a quiet city cannot give a near-zero scale.
- model_scores.csv, copied verbatim from the package's datafiles/, so the
  paper's directory carries the ECI and ForecastBench numbers its figures plot
  against rather than depending on the repo's copy at drawing time.
- model_usage.csv: what each model's calls cost, per eval, from the usage
  sidecars beside the cached responses. The paper reports the run's cost per
  model and per question kind, and neither is recoverable from the forecast
  rows.
- batching_forecasts.csv and batching_runs.csv: the questions-per-prompt
  ablation (configs/batching/), scored the same way, one row per (setting,
  model, question), plus per (setting, model) what was asked, parsed and paid.
- variants_forecasts.csv, variants_runs.csv and variants_settings.csv: the
  prompt variants (configs/prompt variants/), each scored exactly as the main
  run's continuous rows are, one row per (variant, model, question); per
  (variant, model) what was asked, parsed and paid; and per variant what its
  config changed and which variant it is compared against.
- knowledge_answers.csv and knowledge_runs.csv: the knowledge test, one row per
  (model, statement) with the statement's topic, difficulty, truth and the
  model's parsed answer, and per model what its calls cost. Beside them the
  prompts as sent: knowledge_prompt_preamble.txt and the numbered statement
  list of each half, knowledge_prompt_1.txt and knowledge_prompt_2.txt.
- continuous_replays.tar.gz: the ground-truth file of each of the continuous
  config's snapshots, as extract_ground_truth.py wrote it, in one archive.
- gpt5_check_forecasts.csv: the one-question-per-prompt rerun of GPT-5 mini in
  its own data directory (configs/gpt5-check-1q.json5), with each response's
  finish reason, for the appendix's account of that model's failures. Read by
  path from that directory, since a process works in one data directory and
  this one is the paper's.

Model names are written as model *ids*: this world's ":suffix" (":loeff", the
reasoning effort a run was gathered under) is dropped, since the paper reports
one run per model and the leaderboards score the model rather than the effort
setting. The suffix stays the canonical id everywhere upstream — configs, the
response cache, data.json — so it is stripped here, at the boundary, and not
before.

Aggregates are deliberately not written here: every mean, correlation and
bootstrap interval the paper reports is recoverable from these rows, and a
pre-aggregated file beside them would be a second source of truth to keep in
step. The reports' own binary_scores.csv and continuous_scores.csv still live
beside the reports, under the eval labels.

Unparsed forecasts are dropped rather than written as nan: a row here means a
score, and the counts of what was prompted against what parsed belong to the
reports. Both datasets are required — the paper's data is all-or-nothing — and
there is no --incomplete, since a ragged selection makes per-model figures
cover different question sets.

scripts/analyze_paper.py draws the figures from this directory alone.
