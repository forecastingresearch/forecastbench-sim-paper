"""Analyze the gathered paper data: the article's figures, as PDF for LaTeX.

The reporting half of the paper pipeline. Reads only what
scripts/gather_paper_data.py wrote — binary_forecasts.csv,
continuous_forecasts.csv, city_metric_scales.csv and its copy of
model_scores.csv, which the package's own parser is pointed at so the ECI
plotted is the one the gather run captured. No dataset, no ground truth, no
config, and nothing outside that directory: rerunning this to nudge a legend
costs a second and cannot change a number.

The continuous CRPS arrives unnormalized and is divided here, per row, by the
scale its own city and metric carry in city_metric_scales.csv — each metric's
mean over that city's turns up to the first snapshot, floored. One city's
population moving by a thousand is not the same event as another's, so the
division has to happen before the rows are averaged together, not after.

Writes to data/micropolis/paper/figures/extra/:

- eci_vs_excess_brier-mid-range.pdf
- eci_vs_excess_brier-tail.pdf
- eci_vs_excess_bits-tail.pdf        (FreeCiv's tail score)
- eci_vs_excess_ncrps-city.pdf       (the continuous eval)
- eci_vs_excess_{bits,brier}-pooled.pdf  (every binary question, one rule)

"extra" is the figures the article does not currently place; --no-extra draws
only the rest, which today is none of them, so the flag is a way to refresh the
numbers without spending the drawing time. The numbers are written either way.

And to data/micropolis/paper/figures/:

- fig_micropolis_capability.pdf      the article's own capability figure

And to data/micropolis/paper/figures/:

- fig_micropolis_horizon.pdf         each binary score by horizon

And to data/micropolis/paper/:

- micropolis-macros.tex              \\MPD* macros for the article's prose
- micropolis_models.tex              the appendix's per-model table
- micropolis_horizon.tex             the same by horizon
- micropolis_continuous.tex          excess nCRPS by horizon and metric
- micropolis_model_scores.csv        the three cells the combined score fits

fig_micropolis_capability.pdf is the one figure here the article places, so
--no-extra keeps drawing it. Three ECI scatters side by side — continuous,
tail, binary, in the order fbs-paper's fig_freeciv_capability.pdf lays its
four out — styled on that figure so the two worlds' capability figures read as
a pair: 5.5 x 2.04in at the paper's own \\textwidth, text set by LaTeX in
Computer Modern, dark-green points with the best and worst model named in
orange, and no legend, which at 26 models would be wider than the panel it
explains.

Every interval the article quotes for this world is a percentile bootstrap
over the models, which is what would have to generalize for a claim about
model capability. The intervals over questions and over cities are still
computed and still have macros (\\MPDRho*CIQuestions, \\MPDRho*CICities, the
ablation's \\MPDBatch*CI and \\MPDBatch*CICities), but nothing in the paper
reads them, and the capability panels' brackets and the batching figure's
band are the model interval too.

Correlations here are **sign-adjusted** — ECI against minus the score, so a
positive rho means more capable models forecast better, which is the article's
convention and FreeCiv's. The reports' own figures under figures/extra/ keep
the raw negative rho that analysis-brier.md shows. Every number this script
prints, defines as a macro or draws is adjusted; nothing under extra/ is.

The three headline correlations — ECI against the mid-range excess Brier, the
tail excess bits and the continuous excess nCRPS — are printed to stdout and
defined as LaTeX macros, each with its p-value, its model count, its question
count and both bootstrap intervals. They are not recomputed here: the figures'
own correlate() call is intercepted, so a macro and its figure cannot disagree.
Under --no-extra no figure is drawn, and the same correlations are computed
directly instead.

Figure captions are not generated. They live in the article's own .tex, where
they are edited, and quote the macros defined here for every number in them;
this script defines those numbers and nothing about the prose around them.

Each is the report's own ECI scatter — the same points, fit line, Spearman ρ
and Pearson r, and 95% bootstrap intervals, from analyze_binary.py's and
analyze_continuous.py's plot functions — restyled for an article: the title
dropped, since the caption does that job; the per-model legend moved from
beside the axes to below them in four columns, since two dozen models in one
column is wider than the scatter it explains; and the whole sized for a
\\textwidth of about 6.5in with Type 42 fonts.

Model order fixes each model's color and marker, and is taken from the CSV's
own order of first appearance, so a model keeps one identity across the
figures without a config being read. Models are named by model id, the gather
step having dropped this world's ":suffix", so nothing here or in the figures
carries a ":loeff".

When PAPER_REPO_PATH is set — it is, in worlds/micropolis/.env, which
module_globals loads — the run ends by delivering into that checkout of the
article: micropolis-macros.tex to its root, beside math_commands.tex, and
every figure the article places to its figures/, the three appendix tables to
its data/appendix_tables/, and every CSV in the paper's directory to its
data/micropolis/ — the rows every number in the article was computed from.
Nothing from extra/ is copied, that being what extra/ means. An unset variable is a note, since a
machine that only gathers data has no article to deliver to; a variable
pointing at a directory that does not exist is an error, since the alternative
is rebuilding the paper from stale figures and not being told.
