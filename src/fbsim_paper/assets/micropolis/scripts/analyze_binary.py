"""Score the binary eval: Brier and excess Brier tables by question and horizon.

Reads data/micropolis/binary/{label}/data.json, written by
scripts/run_eval_binary.py, and the continuation tallies under
data/micropolis/ground_truth/, written by scripts/extract_ground_truth.py.
Prompts no models and runs no simulations.

Every forecast f gets two scores: the Brier score (f - outcome)^2 against the
realized answer, and the excess Brier (f - p)^2 against p, the share of
reseeded continuations that resolved Yes. The report is split into two
sections by that p: "Mid-range probabilities" (p >= 5%) and "Tail
probabilities" (p < 5%). The split is per question instance, so one qid can be
mid-range in one city and tail in another. The tail section adds a third
score, the excess bits KL(p || f) — the log loss in bits of f under the
continuations' p, minus p's own entropy, with f clipped to [0.001, 0.999] —
since it penalizes the ratio f/p rather than the difference, which is what
tells forecasts apart at p below 5%. It is FreeCiv's tail score, so the two
worlds' tail figures are on one footing. Each section has the same
structure: a histogram of its questions per ground-truth p, the scores
paired within each view (a per-model bar panel, a by-horizon figure), a table
of correlations between the per-model scores and the capability predictors
(ECI, knowledge eval), the ECI scatter and predictor comparison — every
correlation with two 95% bootstrap intervals, over models and over questions
— and finally a grid of per-model calibration scatters. The tail section draws its histogram and its
scatter axes on a log scale, since its probabilities span two decades.
Everything goes to one Markdown report,
data/micropolis/binary/{label}/analysis-brier.md; --no-plot skips the figures.
Beside it goes binary_scores.csv: one row per model x question type (mid-range
or tail, by the same rule) x horizon in years plus an "all" horizon row, with
the prompted and parsed counts and the mean Brier, expected Brier, excess
Brier and excess bits (the last for both types, though only reported on the
tail). And
results.csv: one row per model x question, with the model's forecast (nan
when its response did not parse), the realized answer, the ground-truth p and
the cached response file and line the forecast was read from.
