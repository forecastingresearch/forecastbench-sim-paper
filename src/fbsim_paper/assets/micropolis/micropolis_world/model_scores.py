"""External benchmark scores for the models this world evaluates.

Reads micropolis_world/datafiles/model_scores.csv, the single source for
every score this repo did not measure itself:

  ECI         Epoch's capability index, a general-capability number the
              analyses correlate their own skill scores against.
  FBOverall   The model's overall ForecastBench score, with a 95% confidence
              interval. Real-world forecasting ability, against which this
              world's simulated forecasting is the thing being validated.

The file also carries the model's name as OpenRouter (Name) and ForecastBench
(FBName) spell it, which nothing here reads — they are there so a row can be
traced back to the leaderboard it was copied from.

Models are joined on slug, the id the eval configs and the response cache
use, so a row without one takes part in no analysis. That is deliberate rather
than an oversight to route around: a near-miss slug ("gemini-3.1-flash-lite" for
a row recording "gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview") is a different model checkpoint
with a different score, and guessing that the two are the same would silently
attribute one's benchmark number to the other's forecasts. Filling in the blank
slug in the CSV is the way to bring such a model in.

The one relaxation is this world's own ":suffix" (model_ids.py): the
leaderboards score the model, not the effort setting, so "openai/o3:lowef"
joins the row for "openai/o3".

A missing cell is a missing score, not a zero: ECI, FBOverall and the interval
are each None when blank, and callers drop the model from that particular
figure rather than plotting a hole at the origin.
