    the gathering script in the error messages — the binary eval reuses this

    `incomplete` downgrades the never-gathered rows from an error to a warning
    and keeps every (question, model) pair that *was* gathered, for testing the
    analysis scripts against a run still missing batches. The selection is then
    ragged: each model is scored on the questions it answered, so per-model
    aggregates cover different question sets and are not strictly comparable
    with one another. The warning says so and lists each model's coverage. This
    is a testing aid, not a reporting mode.

    It does not relax the coverage check above: a model, city or horizon the
    dataset knows nothing about is a config/dataset mismatch rather than sparse
