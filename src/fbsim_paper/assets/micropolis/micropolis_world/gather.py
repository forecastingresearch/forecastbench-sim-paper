    file that text lives in — which the caller names in its parse warnings, so
    an unusable forecast can be traced to the response that caused it.

    being asked now — any config change that alters the prompt changes the
    hash, which simply misses the cache rather than risking a stale match.
    An empty reply — a reasoning model can burn the whole token budget
    thinking — is not cached, so the next run retries it; a non-empty reply is
    cached even when unparseable, since retrying greedy decoding would return
    the same text.

    All uncached (batch, model) calls run concurrently under run_prompts's
    global cap, and each response is written to its cache file the moment it
    lands, so an interrupted run keeps what it already paid for. A failed call
    is reported and skipped rather than aborting the run — nothing is cached
    for it, so re-running the script retries exactly the failures.

    `cache_only` makes no calls at all: the cache hits are returned and the
    misses are left absent, exactly as a failed call would be, so the caller
    builds a dataset from whatever was already gathered. Prompts are still
