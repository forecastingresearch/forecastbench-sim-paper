"""Aggregate the usage sidecars left behind by past API calls.

Every kept model response has a usage-{model}-{hash}.json beside it recording
what that call cost (see continuous_eval.usage_path and knowledge_eval.runner's

tables — tokens, cost, and the p50/p90 of the calls' latencies — and flags any
model that more than one upstream provider served. It reads only what is
