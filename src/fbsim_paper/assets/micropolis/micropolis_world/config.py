"""Config-file loading for the scripts in worlds/micropolis/scripts/.

Every script takes an optional config file path as its first positional argument
and reads all of its non-flag parameters from there; behavior toggles
(--dry-run, --quiet, --plot) stay on the command line, as do --seed, --cities,
--disasters, --models and --label, which override the parameters that most
often vary run to run. Omitting the path falls back to configs/default.json5,
or to whatever a script passes as add_config_args(default=...) when its own
needs differ.

A script asks for the keys it needs via Config.get* and errors out if one is
missing, so a single config file can carry the union of every script's
parameters and still be usable by each of them individually.

Configs are parsed as JSON5, so they may contain // and /* */ comments and
trailing commas. Plain JSON is a subset of JSON5 and loads unchanged.
